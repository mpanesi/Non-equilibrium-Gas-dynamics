Course Description

This graduate-level course provides a rigorous foundation in the physics of nonequilibrium gasdynamics. It is intended for scholars and researchers interested in the molecular and quantum-mechanical foundations of high-temperature gas flows, rarefied gases, photon–molecule interactions, and microscale gas dynamics.

The course establishes connections between continuum-scale flow behavior and molecular-scale phenomena. Topics include the molecular derivation of the conservation laws, constitutive relations for transport, shock structure, relaxation processes, and the role of nonequilibrium effects (chemical, vibrational, rotational, and translational). Applications to high-speed and hypersonic flows, re-entry environments, micro- and nano-fluidics, and radiative energy transfer are emphasized.

 
Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

    Understand the molecular derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations.

    Analyze chemical and vibrational nonequilibrium in high-temperature and shocked flows.

    Apply Chapman–Enskog theory for transport property evaluation.

    Assess shock structure and relaxation processes in non-equilibrium flows.

    Recognize the role of photon–molecule interactions and radiative energy exchange.

    Evaluate flows with length scales comparable to the molecular mean free path, including rarefied and microscale regimes.
